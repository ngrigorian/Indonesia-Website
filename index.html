                        The culture of Indonesia has been shaped by long
                        interaction
                        between original
                        indigenous customs
                        and multiple foreign influences. Indonesia is centrally-located along ancient trading routes
                        between
                        the Far East, South Asia and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being
                        strongly
                        influenced by a multitude of religions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism,
                        Hinduism,
                        and Islam, all strong in the major trading cities. The result is a complex cultural mixture,
                        often
                        different from the original indigenous cultures.
                        Examples of the fusion of Islam with Hinduism include Javanese Abangan belief. Balinese
                        dances
                        have
                        stories about ancient Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms, while Islamic art forms and architecture
                        are
                        present in Sumatra, especially in the Minangkabau and Aceh regions. Traditional art, music
                        and
                        sport
                        are combined in a martial art form called Pencak Silat.
                        The Western world has influenced Indonesia in science, technology and modern entertainment
                        such
                        as
                        television shows, film and music, as well as political system and issues. India has notably
                        influenced Indonesian songs and movies. A popular type of song is the Indian-rhythmical
                        dangdut,
                        which is often mixed with Arab and Malay folk music.
                        Despite the influences of foreign culture, some remote Indonesian regions still preserve
                        uniquely
                        indigenous culture. Indigenous ethnic groups Mentawai, Asmat, Dani, Dayak, Toraja and many
                        others
                        are still practising their ethnic rituals, customs and wearing traditional clothes.

                        <p>Indonesian dance reflects the diversity of culture from ethnic groups that composed the
                            nation of Indonesia. Austronesian roots and Melanesian tribal dance forms are visible, and
                            influences ranging from neighbouring Asian countries; such as India, China, and Middle East
                            to European western styles through colonization. Each ethnic group has its own distinct
                            dances; makes total dances in Indonesia are more than 3000 Indonesian original dances.
                            However, the dances of Indonesia can be divided into three eras; the Prehistoric Era, the
                            Hindu/Buddhist Era, and the Era of Islam, and into two genres; court dance and folk dance.

                        For centuries, Indonesian vernacular architecture has shaped settlements in Indonesia which
                        commonly took the form of timber structures built on stilts dominated by a large roof. The most
                        dominant foreign influences on Indonesian architecture were Indian, although European influences
                        have been particularly strong since the 19th century and modern architecture in Indonesia is
                        international in scope.
                        s in much of Southeast Asia, traditional vernacular architecture in Indonesia is built on
                        stilts, with the significant exceptions of Java and Bali. Notable stilt houses are those of the
                        Dayak people in Borneo, the Rumah Gadang of the Minangkabau people in western Sumatra, the Rumah
                        Bolon of the Batak people in northern Sumatra, and the Tongkonan of the Toraja people in
                        Sulawesi. Oversized saddle roofs with large eaves, such as the homes of the Batak and the
                        tongkonan of Toraja, are often bigger than the house they shelter. The fronts of Torajan houses
                        are frequently decorated with buffalo horns, stacked one above another, as an indication of
                        status. The outside walls also frequently feature decorative reliefs.
                        Candi is an Indonesian term to refer to ancient temples. Before the rise of Islam, between the
                        5th to 15th-century Dharmic faiths (Hinduism and Buddhism) were the majority in the Indonesian
                        archipelago, especially in Java and Sumatra. As a result of numerous Hindu temples, locally
                        known as candi, constructed and dominated the landscape of Java.

                        <p>The cuisine of indonesia has been influenced by Chinese culture and Indian culture, as well
                            as by Western culture. However, in return, Indonesian cuisine has also contributed to the
                            cuisines of neighbouring countries, notably Malaysia and Singapore, where Padang or
                            Minangkabau cuisine from West Sumatra is very popular. Also, Satay (Sate in Indonesian),
                            which originated from Java, Madura, and Sumatra, has gained popularity as a street vendor
                            food from Singapore to Thailand. In the 15th century, both the Portuguese and Arab traders
                            arrived in Indonesia with the intention of trading for pepper and other spices. During the
                            colonial era, immigrants from many countries arrived in Indonesia and brought different
                            cultures as well as cuisines.
